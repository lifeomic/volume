This repo is for manifold learning associated (at least initially) with datasets such as Kits19, 

https://github.com/neheller/kits19.git

You will need to run make_pancreas_data.py to generate the data in a format these files understand.  If all goes well,

# python datasets/pancreas.py 

should generate some example volumes.
